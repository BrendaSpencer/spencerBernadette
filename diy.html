    <h2>DIY</h2>
    <p> In a harsh and sometimes frustating world,
      I think it’s important to find the good thing’s in life.
      And to be creative is a great way to relax and reset your mind.
      So here i wil be sharing some of my ideas you can do with
      or without kids.</p>

      <h2>Clicks Fun</h2>

        <p>This was a handy project of ours. Sinds they never played very well
          with clics ending up me finding them everywhere. I decided to use them
          for a purpose. First we sorted them all out and made them into rolls.
          (A bit perfectionist on my side because it probably would just be as
          handy with the colors mixed) A step you probably can skip.</p>

        <p>
          So we started to make a base of seven length and nine wide. then building
          up the sides leaving holes where the shelf would be, I made 3 rows and then
          an opening. Then I made squares to put on the holes and finished my shelfs.
          It was actually pretty easy and fast going. In total I have used 942 clics.

        <p>
          This is a fun project to do with kids. I bought some sticky “cristals” in zeeman and
          a bag of non-sticky and pritt in action. We had a few glass bottles wich I soaked
          in the sink with dreft to get the labels off.

        <p>And then we just decorated the bottles to our likings, even my 2 year old enjoyed it very much.
          With the flowers it looks just amazing and the best part is that they did it themself so they are
          very proud and mommy too☺</p>
