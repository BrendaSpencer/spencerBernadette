        <h4>kids fashion</h4>
        <p> When shopping for my kids, i always like to look
            for unique items. Sometimes it can be expensive,
            but most of the time that’s not the case. I usually
            mix them together. you’ll be suprised how well it works.
            I’ll be posting some of my ideas and mixes with name brands
        </p>

                <p>These sandals I bought at vertbaudet, You can find pretty good sales there but you have to act fast
                    since
                    a lot
                    of these promotions won’t last long.</p>

                <p>These boys sneakers I bought at usc.co.uk for a great price,
                    you do need to consider the delivery fee of 8€ outside of the UK. and the cost to send it
                    back if the size is not right.</p>

                <p>These beautiful sandals I bought at vertbaudet.
                    they have four more color choices wich are black, white, silvery rainbow en fushia, but I
                    liked this the most and so does my daughter. It is real leather and it smells like it too.
                    it is a little tight on the toes but i asume it’ll stretch out after wearing them a few times.
                    The zipper on the back makes it easy to put on. She can be a little lazy some times so
                    she’s very happy that the clasps can stay closed!</p>

                <p>The black skirt was an item from the h&m halloween collection. but to wear it only once seems a bit
                    wastefull so I searched for something to make it suitable for everyday wear. Then I stumbled onto
                    the mustard colored sweater in zara. I think it works very well together!</p>

                <p>Nothing beats a basic jeans with a nice shirt and for everyday jeans, I like those of h&m very much.
                    The shirt is from zara, with the reversive stars it
                    was a big hit.
                    A very happy girl☺</p>

                <img class="bs" src="img/acc8.jpg" alt="">
                <p>when I was brainstorming what to do with my daughter her hair, I came across the butterfly and the
                    flowers, wich are actually for decoration.
                    After i curled her hair, I tried to put them in and they just looked adorable.
                 
                <p>The gold plated hairclips I bought at amazon, they where a pack of 8 pieces it was
                    a feather, moon, bow and triangle. all of
                    them where in ‘gold’ and ‘silver’ color. and they are nice for a special occasion but also very cute
                    for
                    every day use. And not only for girls as
                    I use them too. </p>

               <p>Last but not least: the bag. Wich I find very adorable. I ordered it by vertbaudet,
                    it is nicely made and my daughter loves it and that’s the
                    most important.</p>

                <p>These amazing sneakers, I bought at usc.co.uk. You do need to take in account the delivery fee
                    outside of the uk, wich is 8€ and to send items back,
                    it also has to be paid by you. I never tried to send things back, so I do not know how it really
                    works.
                    I always make sure the sizes are right.</p>

                <p>The white butterfly dress was a sale in h&m, the vest wich i bought
                    at river woods. This is a classic example of something
                    expensive and a little cheaper. I also bought this jeansvest at zara just for those times you want
                    to
                    toughen it up☺</p>

                <p>Another nice match is this pretty pink dress from h&m and a very nice vest with a nice shimmer from

                    woods.</p>

                <p>I bought this at verbaudet. A very adorable suit for my,then, 3 year old, but I
                    do feel that vertbaudet can be a little overpriced
                    for what they deliver. none the less it still is an amazing outfit that I kept because of the nice
                    details like the bowtie en the poche☺</p>

                <p>I have bought this beautiful dress for my girl since we have an important event coming up. I ordered
                    it
                    by zalando, wich I did not find too expensive
                    for such a dress. The embroidered flowers are nicely done. And she looks stunning in it, the back
                    zipper
                    is nicely fitted and the little opening opward towards the button is super cute☺
                    the skirt might be a tad long, but it is nicely full and the shimmer is just adorable. </p>
