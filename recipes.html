        <h2>recipes</h2>
        <p> I try to balance fresh food with frozen food because
            it just makes it all a little bit easier. like
            chopped unions and garlic, it saves me time, smelly
            fingers and no more forgotten unions in my pantry.
            But everyone should do what they are comfortable
            with. Here i will be sharing some of my easy and
            delicious foods.<br>
            Hope you like them as much as my family does
